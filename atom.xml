        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What should my first test be? What should I test next? These are common questions that I&#39;m asked over and over again. I quite often ask these questions myself. Deciding on what to test is hard. Deciding on the order that things should be tested is even harder.[^1] But writing tests first is not the only problem. How often did we get frustrated while dealing with existing tests which we had no idea what they are testing?&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One year ago Mash and I were thinking how great it would be to be surrounded by great craftsmen, work with good clients, mentor talented apprentices, and a have decent office. We thought to ourselves: “We don’t want a company with employees. We want a company where we have friends. Friends where besides enjoying their company, we also admired their professionalism and knowledge.&quot; One year later, we are happy to say we achieved all that. We had a great first year and managed to build a very talented team, which we are hoping to grow even more next year.&lt;/p&gt;
