        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sizing a project is one of the most important things we do and it is often the first thing we need precisely when we have the least amount of information. During a pre-sales meeting the client will usually ask for a &quot;ballpark&quot; figure so that they can understand if the project is feasible. We try to get as much information as possible before we provide a very high-level figure. The approach we take depends on whether the client already has a well defined backlog or if they are expecting us to create the backlog as part of the estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

We all understand that each project is different and that by no means we can apply exactly the same techniques and practices everywhere. However, the text below serves not only as a foundation but also as a guideline for all of us when it comes to user stories. There are many good books and posts written about user stories. By no means this post is meant to be a summary of all the good practices around this area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 90’s we were witnesses of browser wars. Wars which created one of the most hated languages: Javascript. Web designers touch by Javascript at the beginning of 21st century constantly refused to fix bugs titled as “It doesn’t work in Internet Explorer” or “Netscape Navigator doesn’t show…”. At this time we used pure languages and tried to understand the design of our web browser in order to cope with compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;

The aim was to create a plan for their investors in order to release the next round of funding for a social media website. They had a product backlog that was full of of features but they were not sure how to prioritise them. They also had a release roadmap but were unclear as to why certain things needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

I quite often ask these questions myself. Deciding on what to test is hard. Deciding on the order that things should be tested is even harder.[^1] But writing tests first is not the only problem. How often did we get frustrated while dealing with existing tests which we had no idea what they are testing?&lt;/p&gt;

We thought to ourselves: “We don’t want a company with employees. We want a company where we have friends. Friends where besides enjoying their company, we also admired their professionalism and knowledge.&quot; One year later, we are happy to say we achieved all that. We had a great first year and managed to build a very talented team, which we are hoping to grow even more next year.&lt;/p&gt;
