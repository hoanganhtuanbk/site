        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all say that software design is all about trade-offs but how do we actually reason about it? How do we decide how much code we are going to write for a given task? Is the easiest thing that could possibly work the right approach? The simplest? How do we know the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy&quot;&gt;difference between simple and easy&lt;/a&gt;? Is this even the right question?&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Big Data has been a hype for many years. I’ve seen a few “Big Data” projects start in the past with a lot of fanfare and promise.The promise has always been that “we will start getting a holistic picture of our departmental silos and gain numerous insights from our data that will help us get ahead of our competitors”. The promise was rarely, if ever, fulfilled and the “Big Data” team slowly faded into the rest of the melting pot that we call the “IT department” in most large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you spend any time designing applications which use third-party platforms and services, you will have spent time considering Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The &lt;em&gt;tl;dr&lt;/em&gt; part of any SLA, the bit the everyone is actually interested in, is the uptime guarantee. However, this seemingly simple number has some hidden meanings that you should be aware of when designing applications and reporting your SLAs to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

I was also saying that we probably should teach design before TDD (or at least, at the same time). This tweet led to a discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbrains&quot;&gt;J.B. Rainsberger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RonJeffries&quot;&gt;Ron Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others.

Large parts of this journey have patchy-at-best mobile data coverage, so tools with a reliance on a stable internet connection can cause problems. One of these tools is the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
