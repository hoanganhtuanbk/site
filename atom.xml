We didn&#39;t know what to expect: the agenda was to try a &quot;hardcore coderetreat&quot;, in which the constraints would be incredibly difficult, but when you have six headstrong, opinionated people in a room, you really have no idea what&#39;s going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

I released the last chapter of my book &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanpub.com/socra&quot;&gt;Software Craftsmanship: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride&lt;/a&gt;. As an avid reader since a young age, writing a book was always something I wanted to do. For me, it didn&#39;t matter if people would read it or not; I just wanted to write a book I was proud of. I wanted to write a book that would help developers and companies to get better. A book that could inspire developers to care about their craft. I also wanted a book that my kids, at some point in the future, could read and be inspired, even if they had chosen different professions. I&#39;m not sure if they will read it or be inspired by it, but at least I&#39;m giving my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
