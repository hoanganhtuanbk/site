In an effort to get back into it, I thought I&#39;d take &lt;a href=&quot;http://talks.samirtalwar.com/design-patterns-in-the-21st-century.html&quot;&gt;a talk that I presented at JAX London last year&lt;/a&gt;, split it up into blog-sized posts as it&#39;s pretty long, and post them all week. If you haven&#39;t read it before or seen the talk, I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein was one the greatest philosophers of 20th century. His book Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus addresses the limits of language and its relationship with reality. A friend of mine, great polemicist, suggested me to read it some years ago to understand one of his favourites conversational &lt;em&gt;deux ex machina&lt;/em&gt;: &quot;I can&#39;t prove that, because of the inherent insufficiency of the language.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sizing a project is one of the most important things we do and it is often the first thing we need precisely when we have the least amount of information. During a pre-sales meeting the client will usually ask for a &quot;ballpark&quot; figure so that they can understand if the project is feasible. We try to get as much information as possible before we provide a very high-level figure. The approach we take depends on whether the client already has a well defined backlog or if they are expecting us to create the backlog as part of the estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

We all understand that each project is different and that by no means we can apply exactly the same techniques and practices everywhere. However, the text below serves not only as a foundation but also as a guideline for all of us when it comes to user stories. There are many good books and posts written about user stories. By no means this post is meant to be a summary of all the good practices around this area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At this time we used pure languages and tried to understand the design of our web browser in order to cope with compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;

We thought to ourselves: “We don’t want a company with employees. We want a company where we have friends. Friends where besides enjoying their company, we also admired their professionalism and knowledge.&quot; One year later, we are happy to say we achieved all that. We had a great first year and managed to build a very talented team, which we are hoping to grow even more next year.&lt;/p&gt;
